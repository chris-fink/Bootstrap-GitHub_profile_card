# Bootstrap-GitHub_profile_card

This app was built using the GitHub API to allow any user to search a GitHub users username and return a playing card with their profile picture, name, number of public repositories, and a link to their GitHub account.

This was built as a learning experience to explore API's, more advanced JavaScript concepts, and to practice Bootstrap further.
